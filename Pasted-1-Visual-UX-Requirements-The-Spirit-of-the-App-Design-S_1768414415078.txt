1. Visual & UX Requirements (The "Spirit" of the App):
Design Style: Uber Eats-inspired. Use a clean "Card-Grid Layout" (2 columns on mobile).

Components: * Sticky Header with a Language Toggle (Arabic/French).

Horizontal Scrollable Category Bar (Pizzas, Sandwichs, Burgers, Assiettes, Pita/Tacos, Tex-Mex).

Each Food Card must include: A high-quality image placeholder, Item Name, Short Ingredients Description, Price, and a prominent (+) Add Button.

The Smart Cart (Crucial): * A floating bottom bar that appears only when items are added.

Clicking the bar opens a Full-Screen Modal (The Cart View).

In the Cart View, users must be able to: Review items, increase/decrease quantities (+/-), and delete items.

2. Technical Features & Logic:
Dynamic Customization & Price Diff: * When an item is clicked, show options: "Extras" (e.g., +Extra Cheese +1.50€) and "Removals" (e.g., No Onions).

The system must calculate the price difference automatically and update the total before sending.

Multi-language Support: * Full translation for everything: Category names, Item titles, Descriptions, Button labels, and Success messages.

Support RTL (Arabic) and LTR (French) layouts perfectly.

Database Integration (Firebase): * Push orders to /orders/ path.

Order structure: table_id, timestamp, items_array (formatted as: Name + Options + Note), and total_price.

3. Admin/Kitchen Interface:
Create a separate dashboard (admin.html) that listens to Firebase.

Audio Alert: Play a "Ding" sound for every new order.

Display orders as clear cards showing the Table Number and the detailed list of items.

4. Detailed Menu Data (Damas Food Specialties):
Include these sections with all Syrian specialties:

Sandwichs: Shawarma Poulet, Falafel, Kefta, Foie (Fawwa), Shish Taouk.

Pizzas: Margherita, Orientale, 4 Saisons, Damas Special.

Pita/Tacos: Tacos 1/2/3 Viandes, Pita Special.

Assiettes: Assiette Shawarma, Assiette Mixte, Assiette Falafel.

Final Instruction for the AI:
"Ensure the code is clean, single-file for the frontend (index.html), uses Vanilla JS (no heavy frameworks), and handles Firebase connection errors gracefully so the screen never appears empty. Use Google Fonts (Poppins & Cairo) and FontAwesome icons."
